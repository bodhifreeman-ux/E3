         ↓
LUBTFY: Builds custom AI agent using proprietary technology
         ↓
Client: Gets working AI agent deployed on their website
```

## Our Technology (Internal)

LUBTFY uses proprietary technology that gives us competitive advantage:

| Technology | Purpose | Client Visibility |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **CSDL** | AI token compression (40-50%+ savings) | Hidden |
| **ANLT** | Translation layer (Human ↔ CSDL) | Hidden |
| **NEXUS** | Rapid agent creation | Hidden |
| **Archon** | RAG knowledge base (open-source) | Hidden |
| **Pipeline** | Automated deployment | Hidden |

Clients don't see or access these technologies. They just get better, cheaper, faster delivery.
